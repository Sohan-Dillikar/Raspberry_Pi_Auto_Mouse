The first thing you will have to do is enable the I2C Interface on your Raspberry Pi.  To do that go to your terminal on your Raspberry Pi and type :

$ sudo raspi-config

Choose "Interfacing Options" and then choose the "I2C" choice.  Make sure to save your change by choosing "Yes" and "Finish" after you are done.  Once that is done, reboot you Pi by typing :

$ sudo reboot

Once your Raspberry Pi is rebooted, check to see if the I2C Interface is enabled by typing :

$ lsmod | grep i2c

Your output should look like the "lsmod | grep i2c.png" image in this folder.  After that, install the I2C Tools by entering :

$ sudo apt-get install i2c-tools

For the next step to work, you need to make sure that you have already wired up your ADC Module properly.  For help with that, you can check out the "Schematics+Code" folder of this repository.  Then type the following in your terminal :

$ i2cdetect -y 1

If your output looks like one of the two output pictures in this folder, then you are done with that step.  Now go ahead and install the python smbus on your Raspberry Pi by typing :

$ sudo apt-get install python-smbus

Finally, we need to install the ADCDevice Module.  Make sure that you are in the "Modules" directory of this repository.  Then unzip the "ADCDevice_Module" zip file by typing :

$ tar zxvf ADCDevice_Module.tar.gz

Then move into the new directory you just created :

$ cd ADCDevice_Module

Now run the following command to install the module :

$ sudo python3 setup.py install

Now you can use the ADCDevice Module by typing :

>>> from ADCDevice import *

in your Python Shell
